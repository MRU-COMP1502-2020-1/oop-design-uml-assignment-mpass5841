Q3.

prog2.java is better in terms of design consideration than prog1.java. prog2.java uses a private String, rather than a public String, which implements loose coupling. 
This allows the name to be set using the setter method, rather than accessing it directly. This allows it to be easier to understand what each module does, and also
makes it easier to modify modules if needed because it will not affect other modules.

Q4.

The purpose of the MyReader class is to read the resource, however it contains code that is unncessary to this function which is bad coding practice. The beginning of the
class contains code that checks the FTP and ping, which is unrelated to the read and should be in a different class. To make the code more effiecient and have better 
implementation, it should be rewritten like this:

class MyReader {

    // read the resource from disk
    public String readFromDisk(String fileName) {
         return "data of " + fileName;
    }

    // read the resource from web
    public String readFromWeb(String url) {
         return "data of " + url;
    }

    // read the resource from network
    public String readFromNetwork(String networkAddress) {
         return "data of " + networkAddress;
    }

}

class checker() {

 public boolean validateLocation(String pathIP) {
         return ping(pathIP) && checkFTP(pathIP);
    }
    private boolean checkFTP(String pathIP) {
         return true;
    }

    private boolean ping(String pathIP) {
          return true;
    }
}
